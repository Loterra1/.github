Loteraa  - The World’s First Blockchain for Real-Time IoT & AI Data On-Chain
Loteraa is a next-generation blockchain designed to connect real-world IoT and AI data directly to Web3, enabling seamless automation, tokenized rewards, and decentralized data economies with a mission to power the next wave of industrial and consumer blockchain adoption.
At the heart of Loteraa is its on-chain analytical engine, a system that ingests, verifies, and distributes IoT sensor data, AI model outputs, and machine signals in real-time. This powers smart contract executions, DePIN infrastructure, and AI-driven automation across sectors like finance, telecom, logistics, energy, and hardware development.
Loteraa is powered by:
• $LOT – The utility and governance token, enabling staking, network participation, and access to premium data feeds and AI-powered analytics.
The ecosystem includes a developer-first SDK suite, cross-chain data bridges, and incentive mechanisms for both data providers and consumers  ensuring high-quality data liquidity, sustainable usage, and mass adoption. With built-in tokenomics for deflationary supply, hybrid on/off-chain storage, and machine-to-contract execution flows, Loteraa creates a powerful foundation for the MachineFi economy.

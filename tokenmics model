Token Launch Breakdown: What You’ve Provided
Total Supply: 350,000,000 $Terra

Presale Allocation: 15,000,000 (4.3%)

Liquidity Allocation: 14,235,750 (4.07%)

Presale Unlock: 25% unlocked at TGE

Liquidity Lock Period: 30 days

Liquidity %: 100% of raised funds added to liquidity

Unsold Tokens: Will be burned

✅ What's Good (Pros)
Small Presale Supply (4.3%) – This limits whale control and reduces short-term dump risk.

100% Liquidity Commitment – All funds from presale go into liquidity pool, which builds trust.

Unsold Token Burn – This is a deflationary move and creates scarcity, which is investor-positive.

25% Initial Unlock – Provides early access without a full dump; gradual vesting is safer.

Extend lock to at least 6 months or 1 year post-launch via PinkLock or another third-party locker.

 Public Token Roadmap
List TGE → Ecosystem development → Marketplace launch → Mainnet → Data buyer onboarding → Tier-1 CEX listing

Include token sinks: e.g., burning SENSOR for data access or DAO fees
